# VR Relativity Project

This repository contains the final report of my **VR Relativity Project**, developed during my undergraduate studies.

## Project Overview
The project aims to **visualize special relativity effects in virtual reality (VR)** using **Unity** and **Blender**, with support for **Oculus Quest**.  
Key simulated phenomena include:
- **Length contraction**  
- **Doppler effect**  
- **Optical aberration**

The goal is to transform abstract relativistic formulas into **immersive visual experiences**, bridging theoretical physics and interactive learning.  
This project also explores applications in **science education** and **gamified design**.
